# AGENTS.md — Project Conventions for TraceNex / Fy-api

This file provides guidance to coding agents when working in this repository.

## Repository Identity

This repository is **TraceNex**, the user-facing product brand, implemented in the repo directory and GitHub project still named **Fy-api**. It is a downstream fork of `QuantumNous/new-api` with a small overlay of customizations.

- The Go module path intentionally remains `github.com/QuantumNous/new-api`; do not rename it.
- Upstream gateway behavior comes from `QuantumNous/new-api`; TraceNex-specific changes should stay small and merge-friendly.
- Before changing anything, read `OVERLAY.md`. It is the source of truth for TraceNex-specific changes and merge-conflict expectations.
- In the parent workspace, both `Fy-api/` and `TraceNexBiz/` are actively edited. `new-api/` and `old_code/` are read-only references.

### Sibling project: TraceNexBiz (consumer of `/api/internal/*`)

A separate downstream project `~/Projects/apiGateway/TraceNexBiz/` (channel-distribution SaaS, product brand "TraceNex Partner") consumes Fy-api via the `/api/internal/*` routes added in OVERLAY entries B-12..B-18. Contract: HMAC-SHA256 (`X-Auth-KeyId` / `X-Auth-Timestamp` / `X-Auth-Nonce` / `X-Signature`; canonical in `middleware/internal_auth.go::BuildCanonical`) plus `Idempotency-Key`. Any change to that middleware, `controller/tnbiz_internal/*.go`, or the `/api/internal/*` routes is a contract change — `TraceNexBiz/apps/partner-api/internal/infra/fyapi/client_test.go::TestSign_FyApiParity` is the byte-level parity guard. See `OVERLAY-TNBIZ-HANDOFF.md` for current integration state.

### Frontend theme: classic-only

Upstream v1.0 (commit `a42b39760`, 2026-04-28) introduced a parallel `web/default/` frontend (React 19 + TypeScript + Rsbuild + Base UI + Tailwind). TraceNex ships **only** the legacy `web/classic/` frontend (React 18 + Vite + Semi UI). The runtime theme is locked to `"classic"` via `setting/system_setting/theme.go` + `controller/option.go` so the `default` build path is shipped for upstream parity but not selectable. All overlay edits target `web/classic/...` paths.

## Common Commands

### Full-stack dev

```bash
make all                       # build frontend, then start backend dev server
make build-frontend-classic    # bun install + bun run build in web/classic/
make start-backend             # go run main.go
```

### Backend

```bash
go mod tidy
go build -o bin/fy-api
./bin/fy-api                    # default :3000; SQLite unless SQL_DSN is set

go test ./...                   # all backend tests
go test ./... -race             # race detector
go test -cover ./service/...    # coverage for service package tree
go test ./relay/channel/gemini/ -race -run TestBuildUsageFromGeminiMetadata
```

### Frontend (`web/classic/`)

Use Bun for frontend package management and scripts.

```bash
cd web/classic
bun install
bun run dev          # Vite dev server
bun run build        # production build
bun run lint         # Prettier check
bun run lint:fix     # Prettier write
bun run eslint       # ESLint with cache
bun run eslint:fix   # ESLint fix
bun run i18n:extract
bun run i18n:status
bun run i18n:sync
bun run i18n:lint
```

### Server-side deploy via Fabric

The root `fabfile.py` implements the current deployment flow: local git push, server git fetch/checkout, server Podman build, push to ACR, then blue-green deploy using `scripts/prod/06-deploy-blue-green.sh`. Use conda env `fy-api-deploy`.

```bash
conda run -n fy-api-deploy fab info --target=cn
conda run -n fy-api-deploy fab status --target=cn
conda run -n fy-api-deploy fab logs --target=cn --tail=200
conda run -n fy-api-deploy fab release --target=cn --tag=v0.9.8 --ref=origin/main
conda run -n fy-api-deploy fab deploy --target=cn --tag=v0.9.8
conda run -n fy-api-deploy fab rollback --target=cn --tag=v0.9.7

conda run -n fy-api-deploy fab info --target=hk
conda run -n fy-api-deploy fab status --target=hk
conda run -n fy-api-deploy fab logs --target=hk --tail=200
conda run -n fy-api-deploy fab deploy --target=hk --tag=hk-<tag>

conda run -n fy-api-deploy fab preflight --target=cn-test
```

Known targets:

- `cn`: Hangzhou production, `root@8.136.146.211:58422`, key `~/.ssh/tracenex_XN.pem`.
- `hk`: Hong Kong production, `root@47.83.137.1:58422`. Fy-api overlay: replaces the old `sg` production target.
- `cn-test`: Chengdu test env, `root@8.156.88.148:58422`, default SSH key/agent, domains `*-test.tracenex.cn`.
- `hk-test`: Hong Kong test env, `root@47.86.175.72:58422`. Fy-api overlay: replaces the old `sg-test` target.

### Upstream sync orientation

```bash
git fetch upstream
git rev-list --count HEAD..upstream/main
git log HEAD..upstream/main --oneline | head
```

Follow `docs/Weekly-upstream-sync-runbook.md` for the weekly merge flow and the criteria that trigger an on-demand release.

### Pull request workflow

When creating a PR for the user, use a separate git worktree for the PR branch instead of switching the main worktree away from its current branch. This keeps the user's active workspace, IDE state, and untracked files undisturbed.

```bash
git worktree add ../fy-api-pr-<name> -b <branch-name> develop
cd ../fy-api-pr-<name>
# make edits, run tests, commit, push, and create the PR here
```

After the PR is created, leave the main worktree on its original branch. Do not merge the PR unless the user explicitly asks.
After a PR has been merged, remove the temporary PR worktree and delete its local branch so stale worktrees do not accumulate.

### Migration context

SG production was migrated from a legacy self-hosted MySQL (8.222.175.17) on 2026-05-07.

- Source: `8.222.175.17` (decommissioned), databases `tracenex` and `tracenex_log.logs`.
- Target: SG RDS `transnext_db` used by `api.aitracenex.com`.
- SG pre-migration backup: `/opt/fy-api/backup/transnext_db-before-legacy-migration-20260507-231343.sql.gz` on the SG server.
- Legacy MySQL operational access is via `/etc/mysql/debian.cnf`; application DSNs are in `/root/TraceNex/.env`. Do not print database passwords.

## High-Level Architecture

The backend uses a layered structure with the relay layer plugged into request handling for provider routing:

```text
router/        HTTP routing. api-router.go registers /api/*; relay-router.go registers /v1/*, /v1beta/*, /v1/messages, etc.
controller/    HTTP handlers: parse requests, call service/model, return responses.
service/       Business logic: billing, quota, channel selection, OAuth flows, subscription tasks, task billing.
model/         GORM models and DB access. main.go handles DB initialization and migrations.
relay/         AI API proxy core.
  relay/channel/   Provider adapters: openai, claude, gemini, aws, ali, volcengine, minimax, task, codex, etc.
  relay/common/    RelayInfo, stream state, billing helpers, request-body storage.
  relay/helper/    Stream scanning/parsing and relay helpers.
  relay/reasonmap/ Reasoning-effort suffix mapping.
middleware/    Auth, distributor/channel selection, rate limits, i18n, request id, performance, body cleanup.
setting/       Runtime configuration split by concern: model, operation, ratio, performance, system.
common/        Shared utilities: JSON wrapper, env, Redis, crypto, URL/SSRF validation, disk cache.
dto/           Request/response DTOs for OpenAI, Claude, Gemini, task APIs, etc.
constant/      Channel types, API types, context keys, env keys.
types/         Typed errors, relay format enum, generic sets, file source abstractions.
i18n/          Backend i18n using go-i18n and embedded YAML locales.
oauth/         OAuth registry and providers.
pkg/           Internal packages such as cachex, ionet, perf_metrics, billingexpr.
web/           Frontend themes container.
  web/classic/   Active TraceNex frontend (React 18 + Vite + Semi UI). All overlay edits live here.
  web/default/   Upstream v1.0 frontend (React 19 + Rsbuild + Base UI + Tailwind). Built but not selectable.
```

Key architecture patterns:

- **Startup flow**: env/config -> DB open + migrate -> option map -> Redis -> cache -> OAuth registry -> router setup -> HTTP server.
- **Channel adapters**: each provider implements `relay/channel/adapter.go` (`Init`, `GetRequestURL`, `SetupRequestHeader`, `ConvertRequest`, `DoRequest`, `DoResponse`).
- **RelayInfo**: `relay/common/relay_info.go` carries per-request channel, model, user, price, stream, retry, and request-id state through the relay path.
- **Billing pipeline**: `middleware/distributor.go` selects a channel, relay adapters call upstream, then `service/text_quota.go` or `service/task_billing.go` records actual consumption. Usage details must flow into `dto.Usage` for billing.
- **Request ID**: middleware generates `X-Oneapi-Request-Id`; consume/error logs store `model.RequestId`; log endpoints support `?request_id=` filtering.
- **Channel affinity**: `service/channel_affinity.go` keeps consecutive requests from the same user/group on the same upstream channel when configured.
- **Theme switching**: `common/embed-file-system.go` chooses between `web/default/dist` and `web/classic/dist` at runtime via `common.GetTheme()`. TraceNex pins this to `"classic"` (see `setting/system_setting/theme.go`).

## TraceNex Overlay Rules

- Prefer new files over editing upstream files.
- If an upstream file must be touched, add a `// Fy-api overlay:` comment in Go or `{/* Fy-api overlay: */}` in JSX.
- Update `OVERLAY.md` in the same change when adding, removing, or changing TraceNex-specific behavior.
- Preserve upstream attribution: `LICENSE`, `NOTICE`, `THIRD-PARTY-LICENSES.md`, copyright headers, and the Go module path.
- TraceNex brand customizations are allowed for user-facing brand text, logo/favicon, README additions, and package names called out in `OVERLAY.md` / `CLAUDE.md`.
- Do not introduce brand words into frontend i18n keys; keys are Chinese source strings (in `web/classic/`) and brand replacement is value-side via gsub.

## Coding Rules

### JSON wrapper

All JSON marshal/unmarshal operations in business code must use `common/json.go` wrappers:

- `common.Marshal`
- `common.Unmarshal`
- `common.UnmarshalJsonStr`
- `common.DecodeJson`
- `common.GetJsonType`

`encoding/json` types such as `json.RawMessage` and `json.Number` may still be referenced as types.

### Database compatibility

SQLite, MySQL >= 5.7.8, and PostgreSQL >= 9.6 must all remain supported.

- Prefer GORM methods over raw SQL.
- Use `commonGroupCol` and `commonKeyCol` for reserved columns like `group` and `key`.
- Use `commonTrueVal` / `commonFalseVal` and `common.UsingPostgreSQL` / `common.UsingSQLite` / `common.UsingMySQL` for DB-specific branches.
- Avoid DB-specific SQL or column types without cross-DB fallback.
- SQLite migrations should use add-column style workarounds rather than unsupported `ALTER COLUMN` flows.

### Relay DTO zero values

For request structs parsed from client JSON and re-marshaled upstream, optional scalar fields must use pointer types with `omitempty`. Absent fields should be `nil`; explicitly provided zero/false values must remain non-`nil` and be sent upstream.

### New provider/channel work

When adding a new channel, confirm whether the provider supports `StreamOptions`. If supported, add it to the stream-supported channel list.

### Billing expression system — read `pkg/billingexpr/expr.md`

When working on tiered/dynamic billing (expression-based pricing), you MUST read `pkg/billingexpr/expr.md` first. It documents the design philosophy, expression language (variables, functions, examples), full system architecture (editor → storage → pre-consume → settlement → log display), token normalization rules (`p`/`c` auto-exclusion), quota conversion, and expression versioning. All code changes to the billing expression system must follow the patterns described in that document.

## Internationalization

Backend i18n lives in `i18n/` using `nicksnyder/go-i18n/v2` with embedded YAML locale files.

Frontend i18n lives in `web/classic/src/i18n/` using `i18next` + `react-i18next` + browser language detection. Locale files are flat JSON under `web/classic/src/i18n/locales/{lang}.json`, wrapped under `translation`; keys are Chinese source strings. Current frontend languages include `zh-CN`, `zh-TW`, `zh`, `en`, `fr`, `ja`, `ru`, and `vi`.

> Note: `web/default/src/i18n/` (the v1.0 frontend) uses English source strings as keys instead. We don't ship default, but a future B-route migration would need to re-author overlays in that style.

## Channel benchmarking

The `scripts/channel-benchmark/` directory is a self-contained toolkit for measuring channel liveness, load capacity, output quality, and model-substitution integrity. It is independent of the main backend (its own `go.mod` in `go/`, its own `pyproject.toml` in `py/`) so it can be run on any host that has network access to the gateway.

Layout:

    ├── fy_loadtest/                concurrency-ramp load testing

        └── baseline.py             v2 schema w/ recorded_at_iso + health metadata
```

Key invariants when working in this tree:

- **Never rewrite the Go tool to depend on `prometheus/client_golang`.** The zero-dep exposition in `prometheus.go` is deliberate so the binary stays drop-on-prod.
- **Never add brand words (TraceNex / Fy-api) to the starter `public/quality.jsonl`.** It is the ONLY dataset meant to be committed; keeping it brand-neutral avoids the file being a signal leak.
- **Never bypass `row.wire_prompt()` in the quality runner.** Perturbations must be applied before hitting the channel, and the cache key must be derived from the perturbed text so schema changes invalidate caches reliably.
- **Never have a channel judge its own output in `fy-quality`.** Judges are configured independently from channels — keep it that way.
- **Baseline files are data, not code.** `fy_canary/baseline.py`'s load path must stay backwards-compatible with v1 files; upgrades happen on next save, not on load.

```bash
# Smoke / Prometheus
cd scripts/channel-benchmark/go
go test -race ./...                  # full Go test suite
go run . -config channel-benchmark.yaml                        # one-shot

When extending this toolkit, log the change in `OVERLAY.md` entry **B-7** (same file that tracks all TraceNex customizations) so the next upstream sync doesn't lose context.

## Pull Requests

When creating a pull request:

- First compare the current git user (`git config user.name` / `git config user.email`) with the repository's historical core developers, for example the recurring top authors in `git log`. Do not change git config.
- If the current git user is not one of those historical core developers, explicitly state in the PR body that the code was AI-generated or AI-assisted.
- Always use the repository PR template at `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md` when drafting the PR title/body. Preserve the template structure and fill in the relevant sections instead of replacing it with an ad hoc format.

### Rule 9: Backend Test Quality — No Reward-Hacking Tests

Backend tests must protect real behavior, API contracts, billing/accounting invariants, data compatibility, or regression paths. Do not add tests that only improve coverage numbers, prove that code happens to run, or lock in an implementation detail without a user-visible or cross-module contract.

Avoid these test shapes:
- Fake fuzz, stress, smoke, or performance tests built from random inputs, large loop counts, sleeps, timing comparisons, or log-only assertions.
- Duplicate tests that exercise the same branch with different names but no new invariant.
- Tests that force an incorrect provider or protocol semantic into production code.
- Tests that assert private constants, select-field lists, helper internals, or file layout when the observable behavior is already covered elsewhere.
- Hand-written replacements for standard library helpers inside tests.

Prefer deterministic table tests with explicit inputs and exact expected outputs. Merge overlapping tests, remove unclear or redundant cases, and keep file names aligned with the domain or module under test. When a test needs database, request context, user group, settings, or cache state, initialize that state explicitly inside the test fixture rather than relying on global leftovers from other tests.

New or substantially rewritten Go backend tests MUST use `github.com/stretchr/testify/require` for setup and fatal assertions, and `github.com/stretchr/testify/assert` for non-fatal value checks. Avoid hand-written assertion helpers unless they encode a reusable project-specific invariant.

When cleaning tests, preserve meaningful regression coverage. If a deleted test was covering a real contract indirectly, replace it with a smaller test that names and asserts that contract directly.
